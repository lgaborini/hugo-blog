This blog contains a sorted collection of thoughts, analyses, code snippets and mumblings I find to be interesting enough to share with everyone.

#### How it's made

The blog mainly runs in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with theme [Minimo](https://minimo.netlify.com/). Currently hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

Actually, it is built using {{<cran blogdown>}} package, which takes care of compiling Rmarkdown `.Rmd` to markdown files.
